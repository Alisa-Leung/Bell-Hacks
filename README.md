# Spokn
This project was made as part of Bell Hacks, a hackathon on December 14th, 2025.

Spokn is an AI-powered speech and debate tool that utilizes WebSpeech and Gemini APIs that helps students practice their speech without pressure or judgment while also being simple, supportive, and accessible for everyone.\
Key Features:
- Allows users to record their voice and listen back
- Includes a timer for structured practice sessions
- Provides rebuttals for more argumentative speaking
- Uses AI feedback to give tips on pronunciation, clarity, and fluency\
Following the education track, we were inspired by students who struggle with speaking confidently, whether for projects or other extracurriculars. Over the course of ~9 hours, we built Spokn to address this problem through a tangible and accessible tool.
